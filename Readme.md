The *socat ring of fire* is a small python game. 
Get together with a group of friendly people, start the script on each node. 
The script will *hopefully* create a ring of socat proxys, the string "fire" is then send into the ring and will
start to loop the loop. every time the fire hits a node of the ring, the screen will burn a bit more!
With the *socat ring of fire* you are able to not just listen to but also create the ring of fire johnny cash 
keeps singing about.

The idea was part of an assembly of the [CCC-HB](https://ccc-hb.de/ "Chaos Computer Club Bremen") for the 34C3
